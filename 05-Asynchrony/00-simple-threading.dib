# 5.0. Simple Threading

<small>Copyright (c) Mateusz Gienieczko 2022</small>

## How to use this notebook

### Content

This notebook is a part of the C#.NET Course at https://gienieczko.com/teaching/csharp/5-asynchrony.

It covers topics for section [5.0. Simple Threading](https://gienieczko.com/teaching/csharp/5-asynchrony/0-simple-threading).

### Notebook flow

The content within a single subsection of this notebook is self-contained.
However, within a single subsection you need to execute snippets from top to bottom,
as the snippets below might use variables or types that are declared in the snippets above.

### Play around

You can edit the code parts freely and experiment with the language.
That's kind of the point of doing all this in notebooks.

## Running on a Different Thread

**NOTE: The threading API we'll see now is a relatively low-level API, and usually should _not_ be used directly.
We need to introduce it for demonstration reasons before we reach [`5.X. Thread Pool`], but in general
you should never have to interact with the `Thread` class at all.**

We can spawn a child thread by using `System.Threading.Thread`,
with its constructor taking a `ThreadStart` is a delegate type equivalent to `Action`.

#!csharp

using System.Threading;

var thread = new Thread(() => Console.WriteLine("Hello from a different thread."));

#!markdown

This does nothing. To do anything we need to start the thread.

#!csharp

thread.Start();
thread.Join();

#!markdown

Joining _blocks_ the current thread until the other thread finishes.

We can artificially suspend the thread for some time using `Thread.Sleep`.

#!csharp

using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading;

var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
Console.WriteLine("Hello");

stopwatch.Start();
Thread.Sleep(1000);

stopwatch.Stop();
Console.WriteLine(stopwatch.Elapsed);

#!markdown

Finally, we can access the current thread and get its unique ID for diagnostic purposes.

#!csharp

using System.Threading;

static void WriteFromThread(string message) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"[{Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}] {message}");

var thread1 = new Thread(() => WriteFromThread("Hello (1)!"));
var thread2 = new Thread(() => WriteFromThread("Hello (2)!"));

thread1.Start();
thread2.Start();

WriteFromThread("Hello (main)!");
thread1.Join();
thread2.Join();

## Races and Locks

We're on a very low and unsafe level. There's no inherent thread synchronisation
going on.

#!csharp

using System.Threading;

var counter = 0;

var thread = new Thread(() =>
{
    for (var i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i += 1)
    {
        counter++;
    }
});

thread.Start();

for (var i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i += 1)
{
    counter++;
}

thread.Join();

Console.WriteLine(counter);

#!markdown

We'll talk about various synchronisation mechanisms
later, but for now there's a very straightforward mechanism
of a `lock`.

#!csharp

using System.Threading;

var counter = 0;
object lockObject = new object();

var thread = new Thread(() =>
{
    for (var i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i += 1)
    {
        lock (lockObject)
        {
            counter++;
        }
    }
});

thread.Start();

for (var i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i += 1)
{
    lock (lockObject)
    {
        counter++;
    }
}

thread.Join();

Console.WriteLine(counter);

#!markdown

This is a **mutual-exclusion lock** that uses the passed object to enforce
exclusion â€“ only one thread can hold a lock around a given object.

The object must obviously be a reference type to work.

## Summary

We've learnt how to create simple, low-level threads and how to synchronise access with
a primitive mutex.
