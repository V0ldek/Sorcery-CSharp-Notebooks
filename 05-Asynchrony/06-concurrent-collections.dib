## How to use this notebook

### Content

This notebook is a part of the C#.NET Course at https://gienieczko.com/teaching/csharp/5-asynchrony.

It covers topics for section [5.6. Concurrent Collections](https://gienieczko.com/teaching/csharp/5-asynchrony/6-concurrent-collections).

### Notebook flow

The content within a single subsection of this notebook is self-contained.
However, within a single subsection you need to execute snippets from top to bottom,
as the snippets below might use variables or types that are declared in the snippets above.

### Play around

You can edit the code parts freely and experiment with the language.
That's kind of the point of doing all this in notebooks.
